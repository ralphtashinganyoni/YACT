          How accurate is the rapid oral HIV test?

        The rapid oral HIV test detects antibodies made by the immune system in response to HIV infection, just like
        the standard blood antibody test. The rapid oral test, however, detects these antibodies in oral fluid, and
        doesn't require a blood sample.

        The rapid oral HIV test is quite accurate (similar to the standard blood antibody test) for persons with
        chronic, or longstanding, HIV infection, but it is not as accurate for people with new or recent HIV infection.
        Like any antibody test for HIV, the rapid oral HIV test is not reliable during the "window period" (lasting
        several weeks to months) between the time a person is infected and the time the body has made enough antibodies
        for the test to detect. During this window period, someone who is infected might test negative for antibodies
        (a false-negative result). The "window period" for the rapid oral test is longer than it is for some HIV blood
        tests, meaning that for someone with acute or new HIV infection certain blood tests can detect HIV earlier than
        the oral rapid tests can.

        It also is possible to have false-positive results (a person may have a positive rapid oral HIV test result but
        not actually be infected with HIV). That's why anyone who has a positive result with a rapid oral HIV test must
        have a more specific "confirmatory" blood test before a diagnosis of HIV infection can be made.

          What are the risks of getting HIV if you put on a condom after you've already started having sex?

        Condoms work well to prevent HIV infection when one partner is HIV infected and the other isn't. Studies show
        that HIV-uninfected partners are 80% less likely to become infected, if they use condoms properly and
        consistently, compared with those who do not. Consistent condom use means using a condom for every act of
        vaginal (penis in vagina) or anal (penis in butt) sex.

        But sometimes sex gets going before the condom goes on. What are the risks to an HIV-negative person if they
        start having condomless sex with an HIV positive man, but he puts on a condom before he ejaculates?

        For an HIV-negative woman, some studies have suggested that the risk of HIV infection is lower if a male
        partner withdraws before ejaculating than if he doesn't, but the risk is still higher than it is among those
        who use condoms properly and consistently. Why? Well, we know that pre-ejaculate, the sticky-yet-slippery clear
        fluid that a man produces after being sexually aroused but before he ejaculates, can have the virus in it, and
        in enough amounts to be infectious.

        For an HIV-negative man who has sex with men (MSM), at least one study has shown that the odds of becoming
        infected with HIV as a result of having receptive anal sex with delayed condom use were about the same as the
        odds of becoming infected from having anal sex without condoms (or PrEP).

        It's important to mention that PrEP (or pre-exposure prophylaxis), a pill, is very effective at preventing HIV
        if it is taken every day. This may be a good option for you if you are having trouble using condoms
        consistently.

        Having condomless sex increases the risk of contracting other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), such as
        syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and genital herpes. Although these infections are treatable and (with the
        exception of herpes) curable, they often produce no symptoms and can increase the risk of becoming infected
        with HIV. Hepatitis B and C also can be transmitted through unprotected sex. Using condoms properly and
        consistently can decrease your risk of contracting these infections as well. And, proper condom use can prevent
        pregnancy.

        So the bottom line is this: Putting on a condom after you already have started having vaginal or anal sex is
        more risky than using a condom from the start. If it is difficult to talk about condom use with your partner,
        then it's time to find someone who can talk with both of you. Many cities have STD clinics and HIV counseling
        and testing sites that can help partners have these discussions. This also may be a good moment to consider
        PrEP--discuss this with your VA clinician or your local sexual health clinic.

        No. The only way to know if you are infected with HIV is to get tested.

        Although some people do have a flulike illness around the time they get infected, many do not. Also, even if
        you have a flulike illness from HIV, it's usually pretty difficult to tell it apart from ... the flu. So, even
        people who have the symptoms of HIV infection may think they just have the flu.

        Many people with HIV infection, including those with AIDS, don't feel or look sick in any way. They find out
        that they are HIV infected only when they get tested. Sometimes this testing is done as part of routine health
        exams, like getting your cholesterol checked. Other times, people get tested only when they suddenly become
        seriously ill with a life-threatening infection, and their doctors need to know whether the infection is a
        result of a weakened immune system caused by HIV.

        Getting tested for HIV is crucial for protecting your health. It's better to find out you are HIV infected when
        your immune system is still relatively healthy, so that you can start taking medications to control the virus
        before it makes you sick. Also, finding out you are HIV infected allows you to take steps to avoid infecting
        your sex partners or (for women) to prevent transmission to a fetus or infancy during pregnancy or childbirth.

        The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that every adult in the United States be tested
        for HIV at least once. The VHA recommends that voluntary HIV testing be provided to all patients who receive
        medical care, and encourages all Veterans to be tested.

        You may know that we currently recommend HIV treatment (called antiretroviral therapy, or ART) for everyone
        with HIV. That's because research studies show that effective ART improves the health of people with HIV no
        matter the stage of their infection, and it enormously reduces the chance of HIV passing to an HIV-negative sex
        partner. So, all HIV providers almost always offer ART during one of the first clinic visits.

        Some clinics and some local health departments go further and recommend that people with a new diagnosis of HIV
        start treatment immediately, either that same day or within the next few days. This approach sometimes is
        called "Treatment on Diagnosis" or "Rapid ART." There are several reasons for starting treatment at the time of
        HIV diagnosis, but the basic reason is that if early treatment is beneficial, starting treatment at the
        earliest possible time may be even better, and patients may get the benefits of ART sooner. This may be
        especially true for people who are diagnosed very soon after they are infected (during the acute HIV infection
        period). Also, we know that delays or barriers to getting clinic appointments are common, and it may take a
        while to get a prescription for ART, which can result in worse health outcomes. So, strategies that get newly
        diagnosed people straight into care and onto treatment may bypass these barriers.

        For individuals with new diagnoses of HIV who are starting ART immediately, clinicians must choose the
        treatment regimens carefully, and offer extra support and guidance. Please discuss this more with your health
        care provider and decide whether you are ready to start treatment. Remember that this is your decision and you
        should be comfortable with it.
